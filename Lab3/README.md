This lab contains the weather and news API site that was created for lab 3 of ITWS-2110

Work Log:
-------------------------------------
Created a Web app using two APIs to display (geolocated) weather information as well as country top headlines for news.

started by building simple HTML that held many DOM elements for easy API integration

Started Styles but waited to finish until after API integration

Integrated Script and APIs with difficulty, using slides, W3 Schools, and API documentation for much help during process

Resources:
- http://openweathermap.org/API and their documentation on the API
- JavaScript, AJAX & JSON, and API slides provided
- https://newsapi.org/    - Was the first result when searching "news API"
- W3 Schools for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript help
